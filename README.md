# Book Store Application

This is a simple book store application built with Node.js and EJS templating engine. The purpose of this project is to learn Node.js and related technologies, following the course "NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on books.
- **MVC Architecture**: Follow the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern to organize the application's codebase.
- **REST APIs**: Expose RESTful APIs to interact with the application's resources.
- **EJS Templating Engine**: Use EJS for server-side rendering of views and dynamic content.
- **MongoDB Database**: Utilize MongoDB as the database to store book and user data.
- **GraphQL (Optional)**: Explore GraphQL for querying and manipulating data (if covered in the course).
- **Deno (Optional)**: Experiment with Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript (if covered in the course).
